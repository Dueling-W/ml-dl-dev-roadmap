# ml-dl-skills

## Basic Info
- Contains my self-study on machine learning and deep learning, starting from base knowledge (fundamental math) and working my way up to full model deployment
- Feel free to adjust workload to your available free time
- Will contain all textbooks, academic papers, coding, and math notes throughout my journey
- Created because I felt my fundamentals were lacking even after graduating with my Bachelor's
- This repo has a higher focus on ML/DL research, as my goal is to be hired in the R&D field

## File and Folder Organization
- **gantt charts** will show task progression along with all planned readings, math lectures, and coding lessons
  - They will be named: **gantt-month-x1-x2.md** and each file will cover two months
  - Simply open the file to view the gantt chart created using Mermaid, along with links to all my used resources
- All **Academic Papers** and **Textbooks** can be found in their respective folders
- **Math Notes** contains my hand-written math notes taken from Khan Academy
- **Coding Notes** are Jupyter Notebooks created from the accompanying videos, links will be provided at the top of the notebook
- **Coding Projects** contain all my coding projects, I plan to complete a mini project every two weeks
- **Reading Notes** contain notes from bi-weekly readings
